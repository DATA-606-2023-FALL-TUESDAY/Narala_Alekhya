## PROJECTS  
#### Students-Teacher Assignment Database Portal using Python  (June 2021)
- The project is a submission platform for assignments built with Python, DBMS, and PHP.  
- Developed and tested a PHP script to configure, administer, and update the assignment portal's database. I installed a few Python IDEs, pip libraries, and other tools. To configure the database, you'll need Apache server software.  
- The goal of this project is to have students submit their assignments online. The assignments can be shared with the rest of the class. The teacher can then correct those shared assignments using this tool.  

#### Application of Online Banking with Database Connection using Python  (July 2021)
- Developed an online banking system project in Python, as well as a user-friendly UI in Tkinter. 
- Tkinter was used to create the front end for this application. Tkinter is responsible for the login and registration pages, as well as all other pages in the applications.
- Each applicant's online banking app contains security-based credentials, and they can withdraw money, deposit money, or check their account balance
 
#### Twitter sentimental analysis (Feb 2022)
- I completed this project in my bachelor's degree. The major objective of this project is to put into practice an algorithm that automatically categorizes texts as biased either positively or negatively.
- Additionally, sentiment analysis is used to identify whether tweets are neutral, negative, or positively biased toward the topic at hand. Additionally, a PM-Chart, bar diagram, and scatter plot were used to graphically represent the sentiment.

#### Cyber-Bullying Detection on Social Media Using Machine Learning (June 2022)
- I did this project in my bachelor's. The project is based on the research of cyberbullying in social media, employing advanced machine learning and NLP.
- Used Twitter and Wikipedia data to achieve over 90% accuracy in hate speech detection and over 80% in personal attacks.
- Explored various ML algorithms, highlighting NLP's significance and Word2Vec's potential for detection. Contributed to a safer online environment by addressing cyberbullying.

#### Starbucks offers analytics using AzureML & Databricks (May 2023)
- Conducted a Starbucks data analytics project using AzureML and Databricks to assess customer response to BOGO offers on the mobile app.
- Gathered, transformed, and analyzed data from multiple sources using PySpark, with visualization in Tableau.
- Identified demographic groups with high BOGO success rates based on age, transaction history, income, and membership duration, achieving a 50% success rate. Findings can guide targeted marketing and reduce customer churn.
