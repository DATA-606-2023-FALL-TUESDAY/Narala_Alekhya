## 2. Background
**What is it about?** - The topic revolves around the classification of household garbage into various categories, with the primary objective of improving and optimizing the recycling process. The dataset in question has images from 12 distinct categories of household waste, ranging from everyday items like paper and plastic to more specific items like clothes, shoes, and batteries. These images were largely sourced through web scraping, with some being borrowed from existing datasets.

**Why does it matter?** - Environmental Impact: Proper recycling reduces the need for raw material extraction, minimizing environmental degradation and harmful emissions from landfills and incinerators.
Waste Management Efficiency: Correctly categorized waste streamlines recycling processes, ensuring materials are recycled effectively without contamination.
Economic Benefits: Efficient recycling can lead to cost savings and potential revenue generation from recyclable materials.
Promotion of Sustainability: Emphasizing sorting and recycling fosters sustainable living habits, leading to reduced consumption and responsible waste disposal.

**Research questions** -

- Effectiveness of Image Classification: How effectively can machine learning models classify household garbage into the 12 categories based on the provided dataset?

- Influence of Image Source: Given that the images come from various sources (e.g., web scraping, and other datasets), how does the source of the image influence the accuracy of classification?

- Real-world Application: How can the results of this classification be implemented in a real-world garbage sorting facility? What challenges might arise in a real-world setting compared to a controlled dataset?

- Potential for Expansion: Are there other categories of household waste that could be added to this dataset to make it more comprehensive? How would the addition of these categories influence the classification process?

- Impact of Image Quality and Variation: How does the quality and variety of images (e.g., images of new clothes vs. discarded clothes) affect the classification accuracy?

By addressing these research questions, one can gain a deeper understanding of the potential and challenges of using image classification techniques in the realm of waste management and recycling.
